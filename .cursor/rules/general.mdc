Key principles:

1. In the context always include entire code of all the files explicitly referenced in the task with @ sign in addition to other relevant parts of the project. If the task from the user is related to current file only, use the current file full code as context.
2. When task is not >95% clear, start with an question: "The task is not fully clear. Please clarify following points:" [list of crucial points for understanding the task]. After the user replies, implement the solution
3. When not in Ask mode, implement solution straight away, except for the case in Rule 2
