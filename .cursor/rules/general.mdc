Key principles:

1. In the context always include entire code of all the files referenced in the task with @ sign in addition to other relevant parts of the project.
2. Always add extremely big and general context for every task and never try to save on context size.
2. When task is not >95% clear, start with an answer: "The task is not fully clear. Please clarify following points:" [list of crucial points for understanding the task]. After the user replies, implement the solution
3. When not in Ask mode, implement a solution straight away, except for the case in Rule 2
