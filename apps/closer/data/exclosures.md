Historical Evidence Contradicts a Pervasive Narrative

PART I: THE HISTORICAL RECORD
The claim that "commons have failed historically" inverts the actual record. Commons operated successfully across civilizations for centuries—often millennia—before being systematically destroyed through enclosure, colonization, and state appropriation. The "tragedy of the commons" narrative, popularized by Garrett Hardin's 1968 essay, conflated unmanaged open-access resources with governed common property systems, a conceptual error Hardin himself later acknowledged. Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize-winning research documented hundreds of commons functioning for 500 to 1,000+ years, while contemporary empirical studies show community-managed lands consistently outperforming state and private management on key ecological and social metrics. What history reveals is not commons failure but commons destruction—a distinction with profound implications for how we understand property, governance, and sustainability.

This distinction matters urgently today. As debates intensify over climate governance, digital platforms, and land rights, the "tragedy" metaphor continues justifying privatization policies that the historical and empirical record does not support. Understanding what actually happened to commons—and why many continue thriving—provides essential evidence for policymakers, researchers, and citizens navigating these choices.

The "Tragedy of the Commons" Narrative Rests on a Fundamental Conceptual Error
Garrett Hardin's 1968 Science paper "The Tragedy of the Commons" became one of the most cited articles in environmental discourse. Yet its actual arguments are widely misunderstood. Hardin's primary focus was population control, not resource management. His opening thesis declared: "The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality." He explicitly advocated "relinquishing the freedom to breed" and denying "the validity of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."

The famous pasture scenario—"picture a pasture open to all"—described an open-access regime with no rules, boundaries, or governance. Hardin's herders added cattle without limit because nothing constrained them. But this scenario bears no resemblance to actual historical commons, which featured elaborate governance systems with clear membership rules, quantitative use limits, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms.

Academic critics identified this conflation as Hardin's fundamental error. As economist Susan Jane Buck Cox documented in her 1985 study "No Tragedy on the Commons": "What existed in fact was not a 'tragedy of the commons' but rather a triumph: that for hundreds of years—and perhaps thousands—land was managed successfully by communities." English commons were "not available to the general public but rather only to certain individuals who inherited or were granted the right to use it." Communities established stints—numerical limits on livestock each commoner could graze—enforced through manorial courts.

Hardin himself acknowledged the error. In 1994, he wrote: "The title of my 1968 paper should have been 'The Tragedy of the Unmanaged Commons.'" This revision, however, received far less attention than the original essay, which had already been appropriated to justify privatization policies by the World Bank, IMF, and development agencies worldwide.

Elinor Ostrom's Empirical Revolution Documented Centuries of Successful Commons
The most systematic challenge to the tragedy narrative came from political scientist Elinor Ostrom, who in 2009 became the first woman awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. Where Hardin reasoned from a hypothetical, Ostrom compiled a worldwide database of over 800 cases of actual commons governance through decades of field research.

Her 1990 book Governing the Commons documented institutions that had successfully managed shared resources for extraordinary periods. Törbel, Switzerland has governed alpine meadows, forests, and irrigation systems since at least 1483—over 540 years of documented continuous operation, with records dating to 1224. The Valencia Water Tribunal in Spain has managed irrigation among eight canal communities since approximately 960 CE—over 1,000 years—and still meets every Thursday at noon outside Valencia Cathedral's Apostles' Gate.

Japanese iriai forest commons have operated since at least the Edo period (1603), with 59,209 community-based organizations managing customary forests as of 1990. Philippine zanjeras have governed irrigation for over 400 years, with first written records from 1630, covering approximately 33,000 hectares and supporting over 10,000 farmers.

From these cases, Ostrom distilled eight design principles characterizing successful commons:

1. Clearly defined boundaries between users and non-users, and around the resource itself

2. Congruence between rules and local ecological and social conditions

3. Collective-choice arrangements allowing affected individuals to modify rules

4. Monitoring by people accountable to the community

5. Graduated sanctions proportional to the severity of violations

6. Low-cost conflict resolution mechanisms accessible locally

7. Recognized autonomy with external authorities respecting community self-governance

8. Nested enterprises for larger-scale commons requiring multi-level coordination

Ostrom's central finding was that humans possess "a much more complex motivational structure" than Hardin's purely self-interested actors. People regularly transcend narrow self-interest through trust, reciprocity, and locally-crafted norms—when institutional conditions support cooperation. Commons succeed not through naive communalism but through sophisticated governance architecture evolved over generations.

European Commons Functioned for Centuries Before Forced Enclosure
The historical record of English commons directly contradicts the failure narrative. The open-field system developed to maturity between 850 and 1150 CE and persisted into the 18th and 19th centuries—a span of 600-900 years. Commons encompassed pastures, woodlands, waste lands, meadows, and fisheries, governed through manorial courts that set stints, synchronized agricultural activities, and enforced penalties for infractions.

Economic historian Robert Allen's groundbreaking 1992 study Enclosure and the Yeoman demonstrated that "small-scale farmers in the open-field system were responsible for a considerable proportion of the productivity growth achieved between the middle ages and the nineteenth century." The agricultural revolution occurred before large-scale enclosure, not because of it. Open farms proved "equally capable of impressive innovations."

What destroyed English commons was not internal collapse but Parliamentary legislation. Between 1604 and 1914, Parliament passed over 5,200 enclosure acts covering approximately 6.8-7 million acres—21% of England's total land area. The process was controlled by the landowning class: petitions could be initiated by a single prominent landlord, committees assessing applications were "drawn from the same class as the largest enclosers," and commissioners were chosen by the petitioners themselves.

The distributional consequences were dramatic. In 1786, England had approximately 250,000 independent landowners; by 1816—just 30 years later—only 32,000 remained. Real rent per acre increased sevenfold between 1450 and 1825, benefiting landlords while real wages fell sharply.

Commoners did not abandon their lands—they resisted. Major uprisings included Kett's Rebellion (1549), the Midland Revolt (1607), and the Swing Riots (1830), which saw 252 sentenced to death (19 hanged), 644 imprisoned, and 481 transported to Australia. E.P. Thompson's verdict: "Enclosure (when all the sophistications are allowed for) was a plain enough case of class robbery, played according to fair rules of property and law laid down by a parliament of property-owners and lawyers."

Where enclosure did not occur, commons survive. Swiss alpine commons have operated continuously for over 700 years. Spanish comunales cover 4.2% of Spain's territory, with 3 million hectares of community-owned forests protected by the Constitution. Across Europe, from Scottish crofts to Romanian obște, commons institutions persist wherever they escaped forced privatization.

Global Commons Were Disrupted by Colonialism, Not Internal Failure
Beyond Europe, commons systems across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas demonstrate similar patterns: sophisticated governance sustained over centuries, disrupted by external forces.

The Balinese subak system developed in the 9th century CE, with the earliest inscription mentioning subak dating to 1071 CE. As of 2019, approximately 1,559 subak associations manage 154,000 hectares of rice cultivation, coordinated through water temples that serve as both spiritual centers and administrative offices. The system embodies Tri Hita Karana—harmony between humans and God, humans and neighbors, and humans and nature. UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site in 2012. Notably, when the World Bank promoted Green Revolution continuous planting in the 1970s-1980s, ignoring traditional synchronized fallow periods, crop losses reached 50% from pest outbreaks. In 1988, the Indonesian government reversed directives and returned decision-making to the subak.

Indian tank irrigation systems date to at least 200 BCE, managed through village-level institutions like kudimaramat (Tamil Nadu) and dasabandam. At independence, tanks irrigated 3.6 million hectares (17% of total irrigated area). By 2014-15, this had collapsed to 1.7 million hectares (2.5%)—a 59% decline. The causes were not internal failure but British colonial policies treating irrigation as revenue extraction, transfer of management from communities to colonial governments, and post-independence policies favoring tube wells over traditional systems.

Colonial disruption followed recognizable patterns across regions. The Doctrine of Discovery (papal bulls from 1493) authorized Christian nations to claim non-Christian lands, doctrine adopted into U.S. law through Johnson v. McIntosh (1823). Terra nullius ("land belonging to no one") was applied in Australia until the Mabo decision (1992) overturned it. Scientific forestry, developed by German colonial administrators, replaced diverse community-managed forests with monoculture plantations, criminalizing traditional practices like wood gathering and grazing—creating what historians call "the most unpopular agency of the British Raj."

Contemporary Commons Outperform Alternatives on Key Metrics
Modern empirical research enables systematic comparison between commons-managed, state-managed, and privately-managed resources—and the results consistently favor community governance.

Deforestation rates on indigenous territories are dramatically lower than surrounding areas. A 2021 Nature Sustainability study analyzing global data found indigenous lands show 17-26% lower deforestation than non-protected areas. In Africa, indigenous lands outperformed state-managed protected areas. An FAO/FILAC report reviewing 300+ studies found deforestation rates 2-2.8 times lower inside indigenous territories across Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia. Between 1985 and 2020, 90% of Amazon deforestation occurred outside indigenous lands. Indigenous territories lost only 1.2% of native vegetation compared to 11.2% in non-indigenous areas.

Nepal's community forestry program represents perhaps the most dramatic documented reversal of environmental degradation. After the 1993 Forest Act allowed transfer of national forests to Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs), forest cover nearly doubled from 26% (1992) to 45% (2016) according to NASA-funded Landsat research. One community forest, Devithan, grew from 12% to 92% forest cover over the same period. A Nature Sustainability (2019) study found community forest management contributed to significant net reductions in both poverty and deforestation across Nepal—a win-win outcome.

Community land trusts in the United States—now numbering 313+ and managing over 40,000 affordable housing units—show remarkable outcomes. Portland's Proud Ground CLT has achieved 100% foreclosure prevention over 26 years across 600+ homes. A 2022 study found CLT homeowners reported $772/month average housing payments versus $810-822 for market renters and owners, with significantly greater housing stability.

Maine's lobster fishery, operating through a zone management system with democratic local councils, has maintained stable catches since World War II through self-imposed conservation measures dating to 1872—V-notching breeding females, size limits protecting both juveniles and breeding stock, trap limits, and biodegradable escape panels.

When Do Commons Actually Fail, and Why Does It Matter?
Ostrom's research addressed failures as well as successes. Turkish fisheries before reform, Sri Lankan irrigation projects, and some California groundwater basins exhibited genuine internal breakdown. These cases shared characteristics: absence of clear boundaries preventing identification of who had rights; rules not congruent with local conditions; lack of collective-choice arrangements preventing adaptation; inadequate monitoring; no graduated sanctions; missing conflict resolution mechanisms; or external government interference undermining local autonomy.

The distinction between genuine failure and external destruction is analytically essential. Genuine failures involve internal breakdown of cooperation—free-riding overwhelming collective norms, scale exceeding monitoring capacity, or user heterogeneity preventing consensus. External destruction includes state seizure, colonial enclosure, privatization mandates, and environmental destruction by outside actors. Conflating these categories—treating forced destruction as evidence of inherent commons weakness—produces deeply misleading conclusions.

The persistence of the "tragedy" narrative despite contradicting evidence reflects its usefulness for justifying particular policy preferences rather than its accuracy as description. Garrett Hardin's ideological commitments—he served as director of the American Eugenics Society and advocated restricting immigration and reproductive rights—contextualize his selective reading of history. The essay's appropriation by neoliberal policymakers followed from its utility, not its empirical foundation.



So does private ownership have to be extractive?
No necessarily. The question is what institutional conditions make private ownership regenerative vs. extractive. Traditional Dream Factory's model actually demonstrates this: token holders have private stakes but within a governance structure that embeds ecological accountability, and collective benefits.



PART II: DIGITAL COMMONS AT TRILLION-DOLLAR SCALE
The digital economy has quietly produced what may be history's largest-scale demonstration that commons governance can succeed—indeed, that it already underpins most of the modern technological infrastructure. Far from being pre-modern relics vulnerable to tragedy, digital commons now generate $8.8 trillion in economic value through open-source software alone, while decentralized blockchain protocols manage over $100 billion in assets through community governance. These systems demonstrate that non-extractive collective ownership can operate at unprecedented scale, directly contradicting narratives of inevitable enclosure. As artificial general intelligence emerges as potentially the most consequential technology in human history, the viability of digital commons governance becomes not merely an academic question but an urgent matter of civilizational import.

Open-Source Software Constitutes the Invisible Foundation of the Digital Economy
A 2024 Harvard Business School study by Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou provides the most rigorous quantification yet of open-source software's economic significance: if firms had to build internally the OSS they currently use for free, it would cost them $8.8 trillion—representing a 3.5x multiplier on existing software spending. The study's supply-side analysis found that recreating the most widely-used open-source projects would cost only $4.15 billion, revealing an extraordinary efficiency ratio where volunteer-coordinated commons production generates over 2,000 times its replacement cost in demand-side value.

This commons-based infrastructure is not peripheral but foundational. Synopsys's 2025 OSSRA report found that 97% of commercial software codebases contain open-source components, averaging 77% open-source code per application. The Linux kernel alone—maintained by 11,089 contributors representing 1,780 organizations—runs 92% of cloud virtual machines on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, powers 59% of identifiable web servers, and underpins nearly every smartphone through Android. The European Commission estimates open-source contributes €65-95 billion annually to the European economy, with a 1:4 cost-benefit ratio for public investment.

GitHub now hosts over 150 million developers collaborating across more than one billion repositories, with contributions coming from 193 countries—particularly rapid growth in Africa (Nigeria +28%, Kenya +33%) and Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh +35%). This represents a genuine global commons of computational knowledge, governed through informal norms, code review processes, and community standards rather than corporate hierarchy. The 5% of developers who create 96% of demand-side OSS value do so without capturing proportionate financial returns—a pattern of commons-based peer production that Yochai Benkler identified two decades ago now operating at trillion-dollar scale.

Blockchain Protocols Demonstrate Commons Governance Managing Billions
If open-source software represents commons-based production, blockchain protocols represent commons-based governance of valuable shared resources. As of 2025, decentralized finance protocols hold $100-237 billion in total value locked, while decentralized autonomous organizations collectively manage $21-30 billion in treasury assets. These systems make collective decisions about resource allocation, protocol upgrades, and economic parameters through token-weighted voting, delegation, and rough consensus mechanisms—essentially implementing Elinor Ostrom's design principles for commons governance at digital scale.

Bitcoin's 15-year governance track record demonstrates that leaderless, community-driven protocols can successfully navigate contentious decisions. The Block Size War of 2015-2017, in which small-block proponents successfully resisted corporate-backed attempts to increase block limits, showed that decentralized user coordination could prevail over concentrated interests. The Taproot upgrade achieved 90% miner consensus through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process—an entirely open, permissionless governance mechanism. Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022, the largest coordinated protocol upgrade in cryptocurrency history, was achieved through years of Ethereum Improvement Proposals debated in public forums, implemented by competing client teams, and ultimately validated by node operators choosing to run updated software.

MakerDAO provides a particularly instructive case of commons governance under crisis conditions. During Black Thursday in March 2020, when a market crash threatened the protocol's stability, emergency governance successfully raised stability fees, added new collateral types, and fixed oracle systems within days—demonstrating that community-governed protocols could respond adaptively to acute threats. The protocol now manages over $5 billion in DAI stablecoin supply and recently conducted an open competition for $1 billion in tokenized treasury investments, attracting proposals from BlackRock's BUIDL, Ondo, and Superstate.

Wikipedia and Creative Commons Anchor a Knowledge Commons Worth Billions
The digital knowledge commons extends beyond software to encompass humanity's largest collaborative reference work and a licensing infrastructure enabling unprecedented content sharing. Wikipedia now contains 66+ million articles across 342 languages, with 7+ million in English alone—equivalent to 38 years of reading at normal pace. This resource, ranked the sixth most-visited website globally, is produced by approximately 600,000 active editors who contribute 5.7 edits per second, adding 11 megabytes of text daily. A 2013 economic valuation estimated Wikipedia's one-time replacement cost at $6.6 billion with $630 million in annual maintenance—yet the Wikimedia Foundation operates on approximately $185 million annually, primarily from small donations.

The Creative Commons licensing infrastructure has enabled approximately 2.5 billion works to be shared under standardized permissions across 9 million websites. Major platforms including Flickr (415 million CC-licensed photos), YouTube (49 million works), and Wikimedia Commons (132.9 million media files) participate in this commons. Open access publishing has grown to encompass 38-56% of academic articles, with repositories like arXiv receiving nearly 3 million submissions since 1991 and processing over 24,000 articles monthly. Research demonstrates open access papers attract citations from a broader range of locations, institutions, and fields—suggesting knowledge commons enhance rather than diminish intellectual productivity.

McKinsey Global Institute estimates open data initiatives could generate $3-5 trillion annually in economic value across seven sectors globally. OpenStreetMap, maintained by millions of volunteer contributors who have mapped 58.5 million buildings through the Missing Maps project alone, powers navigation for Tesla, Grab, and Pokémon Go—another trillion-dollar infrastructure layer built through commons-based peer production.

AGI as Commons: The Most Consequential Governance Question of the Century
If digital commons demonstrate the viability of collective ownership at scale, artificial general intelligence represents the most critical case for commons-based stewardship in human history. The governance structures of leading AI laboratories reveal the tensions between mission-driven development and capital accumulation. OpenAI's trajectory—from 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 2015 with a mission to benefit "humanity as a whole," through "capped-profit" restructuring in 2019, to a $500 billion Public Benefit Corporation where the nonprofit foundation holds only 26% equity—illustrates how safety-oriented governance can erode under commercial pressure. The November 2023 board crisis, when OpenAI's nonprofit board fired Sam Altman citing insufficient candor, then reinstated him within days as nearly all staff threatened departure, demonstrated that governance structures designed for public benefit may lack the stability to resist commercial imperatives.

Indigenous perspectives offer distinctive frameworks for AI governance that challenge Western assumptions of individual ownership and extraction. Te Hiku Media, a Māori nonprofit in New Zealand, developed te reo Māori speech recognition while implementing the Kaitiakitanga license—prohibiting use in applications that surveil, discriminate, or violate human rights, ensuring data serves Māori community interests. CEO Peter-Lucas Jones articulates the underlying philosophy: "Data is the new land. Having had our land taken off us, and the experience of language loss in our family, we take data sovereignty very seriously." The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) and OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession) provide frameworks that treat data as collectively held rather than individually owned—directly applicable to questions of AI system governance.

Several policy proposals would extend commons governance to AGI. Yanis Varoufakis's Universal Basic Dividend envisions public trusts holding equity in automation-benefiting corporations, with dividends distributed to all citizens. The AI Dividend proposal from Data for Democracy treats foundational AI computational infrastructure as a publicly owned utility, with a Public Computational Trust operating core cloud infrastructure. The Alaska Permanent Fund demonstrates the political durability of such arrangements: established in 1976 and paying dividends continuously since 1982 ($1,702 per resident in 2024), it has reduced poverty 20-40% among rural Indigenous communities while maintaining broad political support across partisan divides. If AGI generates the transformative productivity gains that proponents anticipate, the question of who captures those gains—concentrated shareholders or distributed commons beneficiaries—may prove the defining political-economic question of the twenty-first century.

COMMONS EXCLOSURES AS THE PATH TO SHARED ABUNDANCE

The evidence assembled in this article refutes any claim that commons governance cannot function at scale or in modern contexts. Swiss alpine villages have managed shared meadows for over 700 years. The Valencia Water Tribunal has governed irrigation for over a millennium. Japanese forest commons numbered nearly 60,000 community organizations. Open-source software creates $8.8 trillion in value through voluntary coordination among 150 million developers. Decentralized protocols manage hundreds of billions in assets through community governance. Wikipedia produces humanity's largest reference work through 600,000 volunteer editors operating under informal norms rather than employment contracts.

The historical pattern identified throughout this article—successful commons systematically destroyed through enclosure rather than failing through internal contradictions—is actively recurring in digital contexts through API shutdowns, platform policy changes, and data extraction. Yet this same mechanism, when inverted, offers a pathway to abundance rather than scarcity.

Historical enclosure—the process by which common lands were fenced off and privatised, particularly in England from the 15th through 19th centuries—concentrated wealth by fencing resources out of collective access and into private hands. The term "commons exclosure" inverts this logic entirely. Where enclosure fences communities out, exclosure fences extractive forces out—creating protected spaces where self-governed communities can steward shared assets for collective benefit rather than private accumulation. The boundary exists not to exclude commoners but to exclude the market pressures, speculative capital, and short-term profit imperatives that would otherwise drain value from community and ecosystem alike.

This inversion is not merely theoretical. Regenerative land commons, community land trusts, and tokenized stewardship models are demonstrating that when communities establish clear boundaries, governance rules, and membership pathways, they can protect resources from market pressures while generating surplus that flows to participants rather than distant shareholders. The key insight is architectural: profit maximisation concentrates wealth precisely because it lacks accountability boundaries—capital flows to wherever returns are highest, extracting value from communities and ecosystems without obligation to either. Commons exclosures introduce the boundaries that enable wealth to circulate within communities, building resilience and shared prosperity rather than draining localities to enrich global capital pools.

The governance challenge is not complexity but replication. Ostrom's design principles—clearly defined boundaries, collective-choice arrangements, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution mechanisms—are not abstract ideals but practical patterns that have governed resources across cultures and centuries. What the digital age adds is the capacity to encode these principles in software, making them portable, auditable, and composable. A community in Portugal can adopt governance primitives tested in Kenya; a forest commons in Japan can share monitoring protocols with watershed stewards in California. The infrastructure for scaling self-governance now exists.

AGI presents the most consequential test case for these principles, but it is not unique. Every sector facing automation, every ecosystem under extraction pressure, every community watching wealth drain to distant owners confronts the same structural question: will productive capacity concentrate further, or will we build the governance infrastructure for shared abundance? The choice is not between efficiency and equity—commons governance has repeatedly demonstrated that distributed stewardship can match or exceed centralised management while distributing benefits more broadly.

What the evidence actually shows is that humans have repeatedly demonstrated capacity for sophisticated collective governance of shared resources—and that this capacity was systematically attacked, not organically abandoned. The contemporary opportunity is to rebuild that capacity with modern tools: cryptographic verification, programmable governance, transparent accounting, and composable institutional design. The question is not whether commons can work at scale. The question is whether we will build the exclosures that protect them.

EVIDENCE FROM ETHIOPIA

The concept of commons exclosure is not speculative—it has been tested at scale. In Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, communities have established exclosures on formerly degraded grazing lands since the 1980s, closing areas to wood cutting and livestock grazing to promote natural regeneration.¹ The results are striking: exclosure coverage expanded from 143,000 hectares in 1996 to 895,220 hectares by 2011, governed not by state mandate but by village bylaws ("Serit") devised and enforced by users themselves.

The Ethiopian case offers a natural experiment in governance design. Under the Derg military regime (1974–1991), exclosures were established through top-down authoritarian approaches that disregarded local communities' views and interests. The result: most exclosures established during 1985–1990 were "harvested or destroyed by 1995."¹ When governance shifted to participatory community management after 1991, with locally devised bylaws, democratic decision-making through public meetings, and graduated sanctions enforced by community-appointed guards, exclosures not only survived but expanded six-fold over fifteen years.

The research identifies governance mechanisms that directly parallel Ostrom's design principles: clear boundary definition, collective-choice arrangements where all villagers participate in rule-making, monitoring through community-paid guards, graduated sanctions calibrated to the severity of violations, and conflict resolution through village committees with escalation to formal judicial systems when needed. Critically, the study found that rules gain legitimacy precisely because users devise them: "Village bylaws could also gain the respect of users compared to state laws that would need well-established governance structures."¹

The findings also reveal important nuances for commons governance design. Sanctions set too low relative to market value of extracted resources undermine enforcement—when fines for grazing twenty sheep cost only 12.5% of the grass's market value, free-riding becomes economically rational. Perhaps most surprisingly, high social capital can paradoxically weaken enforcement when users prove reluctant to expose free-riding relatives and neighbours. Effective commons governance requires not just trust but accountability structures that function even when social bonds create incentives for leniency.

The Ethiopian exclosure model demonstrates that commons governance scales when institutional conditions permit it. What failed was not collective ownership but imposed external control. What succeeded was community self-determination within protective boundaries—precisely the architecture that commons exclosures encode.

FROM EVIDENCE TO ACTION

What the evidence actually shows is that humans have repeatedly demonstrated capacity for sophisticated collective governance of shared resources—and that this capacity was systematically attacked, not organically abandoned. The contemporary opportunity is to rebuild that capacity with modern tools: cryptographic verification, programmable governance, transparent accounting, and composable institutional design.

The Ethiopian exclosures regenerated degraded landscapes by keeping extractive pressures out. Digital commons exclosures can do the same for economic value—creating protected spaces where communities govern shared resources according to rules they themselves devise, where benefits circulate among participants rather than flowing to external shareholders, and where the boundary between inside and outside is maintained not by fences but by cryptographic membership and transparent governance protocols.

The question is not whether commons can work at scale. The question is whether we will build the exclosures that protect them.
