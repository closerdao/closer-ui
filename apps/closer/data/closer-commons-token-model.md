$CLOSER
Commons Infrastructure for the Post-Scarcity Transition
A token model for funding regenerative coordination infrastructure
The Thesis
We are entering an era where code is abundant (AGI writes it), energy is abundant (fusion provides it), and compute is abundant (it follows energy). What remains scarce?
Trust. Land. Coordination.
The bottleneck for regenerative transition isn't technology — it's the social infrastructure that allows communities to find each other, trust each other, and coordinate resources across boundaries.
$CLOSER is not a bet on a platform. It's a stake in the coordination layer for post-scarcity villages.

What Closer Actually Is
Closer is a federation protocol for regenerative communities. It consists of:
Physical Nodes (Villages)
Land-based projects running Closer software: ecovillages, co-living spaces, regenerative farms. Each manages its own bookings, events, memberships, and governance. TDF in Portugal is the first. There will be hundreds.
Trust Networks (Passports)
Distributed communities that curate membership based on shared values, not geography. They issue portable credentials — passports — that travel with individuals across physical nodes. A Nomad Farm member arriving at TDF carries reputation from their home network.
Federation Hubs (Coordination)
The connective tissue. api.closer.earth is the first hub — it coordinates passport lookups, syncs credentials across communities, and enables cross-network discovery. But the architecture is federated: any community can become a hub. The protocol is the product, not the server.
AI Agents (Institutional Memory)
Each community can run an AI agent that serves as its collective memory — ingesting governance documents, meeting transcripts, and community knowledge. These agents don't replace human governance; they make it more accessible.

Why Federation Matters
The 2018 token model was: "Buy our token, use our platform, we capture value."
The Closer model is: "Fund the commons, govern the protocol, communities capture value."
This matters because:
1. No single point of capture
Villages don't pay rent to a platform. They run their own nodes. The federation hub coordinates but doesn't extract. If api.closer.earth disappeared tomorrow, communities would still function — they'd just lose cross-network discovery until another hub emerged.
2. Trust is the real asset
The passport system creates a trust graph — who has stayed where, who vouches for whom, which networks have agreements with which spaces. This graph is the valuable thing. It can't be copied by a competitor because it's built through lived experience across physical places.
3. Network effects without lock-in
More villages in the network = more places your passport works = more valuable to hold credentials. But any community can fork, run their own hub, or leave. The network effects come from coordination value, not switching costs.

The $CLOSER Token
$CLOSER is a pure governance token for the federation protocol. It is not:
	•	A payment token (communities use their own currencies or fiat)
	•	A security (no revenue share, no equity, no profit rights)
	•	A membership to any single village (those have their own tokens)
	•	A speculative asset (there's no burn mechanism or artificial scarcity)
$CLOSER is governance over the commons layer that makes the network function.
What Token Holders Govern
Domain
Decisions
Protocol Evolution
Which features get built, technical standards, API design, breaking changes
Network Admission
Criteria for new villages and trust networks joining the federation
Treasury Allocation
How commons funds are spent — grants, bounties, infrastructure
Federation Rules
How hubs coordinate, data sharing policies, dispute resolution
Credential Standards
What credentials mean, verification requirements, expiration policies
Application Marketplace
Which apps are approved, security standards, revenue sharing with developers

Why Hold Tokens in a Federation Hub?
This is the core question. In a decentralized network of physical and digital communities, why does it benefit anyone to hold tokens in a coordination layer?
For Web3 Organizations
You're building protocols for coordination. Closer is a live testbed — real communities, real governance, real reputation systems. Holding $CLOSER means:
	•	Influence over how portable identity actually works in practice (not theory)
	•	Access to data on what coordination patterns emerge between physical communities
	•	A seat at the table when decisions are made about cross-chain integrations, ZK implementations, credential standards
	•	Partnership pathways — your protocol could become an application in the Closer marketplace
	•	Research access — longitudinal data on how trust networks form and evolve
For Non-Profits & Foundations
You fund impact. Closer is infrastructure that multiplies impact — every village that joins the network makes every other village more viable. Holding $CLOSER means:
	•	Governance over how the network grows (which regions, which types of communities)
	•	Influence on accessibility — ensuring the protocol serves under-resourced communities, not just wealthy ecovillages
	•	Transparency into how coordination infrastructure actually gets used
	•	A multiplier on direct grants — funding the network makes every village grant more effective
	•	Long-term stake in regenerative coordination infrastructure (this is 50-year infrastructure, not a 3-year grant cycle)
For Family Offices & Impact Investors
You're looking for asymmetric bets on civilizational infrastructure. Closer is a bet that the future is federated, regenerative, and physical. Holding $CLOSER means:
	•	Exposure to the coordination layer of regenerative real estate (without the real estate risk)
	•	Governance over protocol evolution — you shape what gets built
	•	Network intelligence — see which communities are thriving, which models work, where the movement is going
	•	Optionality — if you later want to invest directly in villages, you have relationships and data
	•	Values alignment — your capital builds commons, not another extractive platform

The Post-AGI Argument
Here's the uncomfortable truth: most software becomes worthless when AGI arrives. Code is about to be abundant. What doesn't become abundant?
Physical places
You can't prompt your way to 25 hectares of regenerating Portuguese farmland. Land is finite. Communities that steward land well will be the scarce resource.
Trust relationships
AGI can write code, but it can't manufacture the trust that comes from someone staying at your village, contributing, and being vouched for by your community. Trust graphs are built through time and presence.
Coordination precedent
The first federation that actually works becomes the Schelling point. Closer isn't competing on features (AGI equalizes that). It's competing on being the place where regenerative communities already coordinate.
$CLOSER is a bet that in a post-scarcity world, the scarce things are places, trust, and the coordination layer that connects them.

Governance Mechanism
Conviction voting with delegation. Your vote weight increases the longer you commit to a position. This favors long-term thinking over reactive governance. You can delegate to others who share your values if you don't want to vote on every proposal.
No Artificial Scarcity
There's no burn mechanism. No staking rewards that dilute non-stakers. No games. The token's value comes from one thing: governance over infrastructure that matters. If the infrastructure doesn't matter, the token shouldn't have value.
Rage Quit
Token holders can exit their proportional share of the treasury at any time. If you disagree with the direction, you're not trapped. This keeps governance accountable — you can't ignore minority holders if they can leave with their share.

The Ask
OASA is raising €800K–€1.2M to build Closer v4 — the federation layer that makes all of this work.
This funds:
	•	Passport system (portable identity across communities)
	•	Federation protocol (how hubs coordinate)
	•	Cross-community agreements (the legal + technical infrastructure for revenue sharing)
	•	AI agent framework (institutional memory for communities)
	•	Application marketplace (so communities can extend their capabilities)
We're not raising from VCs because VCs optimize for exit. We're building 50-year infrastructure. We want holders who are here for the coordination layer, not the flip.

What Success Looks Like
2027: 50 villages on the network. 10,000 passport holders. Cross-community stays are normal — your reputation travels with you.
2030: 500 villages. Multiple federation hubs (regional, thematic). Trust networks issue credentials that mean something. The phrase "regenerative nomad" has infrastructure to support it.
2035: 1,000+ villages. The network is the default coordination layer for land-based regenerative projects. AGI writes the code; humans govern the trust. Physical places connected by digital commons.
This isn't a pitch for a startup. It's an invitation to fund the commons.
