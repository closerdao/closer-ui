    "description": "Hi friends ü§∏üèΩ\n\nIf you have arrived here, you know what the shebang is about. The coven gathers in the land where dreams are alive, the Traditional Dream Factory. Let‚Äôs remind ourselves of why we are so precious - to ourselves and to each other. Let's share our projects, our gifts and skills, our challenges and successes. Let's listen and talk with each-other and rock life together. And let‚Äôs have some fun üï∫ fun ü§∏üèΩ¬†fun üßöüèΩ¬†Who doesn't love a lil classik rave or a no-talent dinner show? All of this whilst, of course, caring for our mama planet, connecting with the terra that holds us üå±\n\nLet‚Äôs keep it easy and simple. We all know the deal, we just need to show up and be. Meals will be cooked together and in case you have a workshop or a gift you would like to share, you can ping Josh or Bea. We have a little thread to guide our days but we also want to make it fluid and open to y‚Äôall. These days will be a mix or intentional emotional and physical expression and rest. It‚Äôs a wholesome retreat. You can expect to have a lot of free time to wonder, sleep, play and chat. \n\nThe tickets include accommodation, food and drinks. Creatures contributing to the program get a lower-cost ticket as a sign of appreciation. We tried to keep costs as low as possible, and there is nevertheless a buffer value just in case. During our days together we will decide how to spend that money (if there will be any left). \n\nIn case you cannot afford The Loveship PLEASE REACH OUT. We have some money from old Treehouse days that we thought could be used for this moment :) \n\nIf you have any questions, check the FAQ at https://tinyurl.com/2j4ds4zr and if they remain -> Bea or Josh. \n\nSending y‚Äôall much love and looking forward to seeing you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•\n\nüé™ Stay with us at TDF before or after The Loveship!! Let us know you're coming with the 'BOOKING FORM' at the top of this Visitor's Guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/198vWYEQCC1lELQa8f76Jcw3l3UDiPcBKt04PGFKnUvg/edit\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è üé• DOCUMENTATION NOTICE: We'll take video and photos during this event to provide memories when we're older and wiser. You won't be photographed if you don't want to be. You can let us know your needs through a form in the Participation Guide which you'll receive with your ticket :)",

    "description": "How are you feeling these days? Vibrant, happy, and full of energy? Or fatigued, dull, moody, and stressed out? How you feel is linked with your body‚Äôs ability to detoxify and rejuvenate on a daily basis. Ancient wisdom has it that exactly at the juncture of seasons (fall and spring), the chance to develop imbalance and disease is great, and it is a perfect opportunity to (re-)align yourself with nature and boost the body‚Äôs innate self-repair system.\n\nDuring this mini-retreat - facilitated by Ulli Allmendinger, MSc Ayurveda - we will start our days with some movement accompanied by special aromatic blends, followed by lectures, demos, herbal tonics, and shared Ayurvedic meals together. The highlight will be our Sunday afternoon herbal hike in the Portuguese countryside, enjoying the blossoms as well as learning about various medicinal local herbs and flowers.\n\nIn this weekend - retreat, you will learn how to:\n\n‚Ä¢ Navigate spring season according to Ayurveda\n\n‚Ä¢ Balance the sluggish and heavy Kapha energy in body and mind\n\n‚Ä¢ Cleanse the liver for better energy and fat metabolism\n\n‚Ä¢ Lose excess weight effortlessly\n\n‚Ä¢ Re-set your eating habits & beat sugar and coffee cravings\n\n‚Ä¢ Taste delicious detox tonics\n\n‚Ä¢ Make a personal oil blend to take with you\n\nFor more info please visit \nhttps://www.ulli-ayurveda.com/en/teaching/retreats/blossom-into-spring\n\nTo register, please email \nbige.ergez@gmail.com",
