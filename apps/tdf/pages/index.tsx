          and altered it&apos;s ecology to the point of entering the 6th mass

            , which aims to create a regenerative co-living model. OASA&apos;s
            mision is to put land into conservation while offering it as commons
            to be be regenerated to its community of members. TDF operates
            through a DAO that issues the $TDF token through the OASA
            Association, and its tokenomics are designed to optimize common
            resources while nurturing a creative and thriving community and
            leaving a positive trace on the environment. The $TDF token is an
            ERC-20 token deployed on the Celo network. The $TDF issuance policy
            is regulated by the TDF Sale Price Curve, which mints new tokens on
            demand from the market within the limits set by the DAO. TDF DAO has
            established a target supply of 18,600 $TDF (see{' '}
