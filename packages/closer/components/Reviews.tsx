It feels like a healing sanctuary in connection with nature, 
A pioneer in the space of innovation and sustainable living,
A meeting point for the most interesting deep thinkers, change-makers and rebels,
A playground for the kids in all of us that never want to grow up,
A place for dreamers to see and create their soul missions. 
And most of all, TDF feels like HOME for anyone, who puts the values of freedom, living in integrity and in community first to their hearts.`,
